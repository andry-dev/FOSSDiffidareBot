# FOSSDiffidareBot

A FOSS reimplementation of "@DiffidareBot" (an Italian Telegram bot) in Ruby.

This is my first Ruby application, please no bully.

## Building

```
bundle install
```

## Running

Copy `config/config.yaml.example` in `config/config.yaml` and set the API token
there.

Then just do `ruby main.rb`.
